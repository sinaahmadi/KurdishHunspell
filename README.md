---
### Latest update on September 15th, 2021
- [x] Morphosyntactic tags, i.e. `po`
- [x] Inflectional tags, i.e. `is`
- [ ] stems, i.e. `st` (verbal stems added in Version 0.1.2)
- [ ] Derivational tags, i.e. `ds`
- [ ] Creating the plugin for Microsoft Office and LibreOffice

[Hunspell](http://hunspell.github.io/) is a spell checker and morphological analyzer originally designed for languages with rich morphology and complex word compounding. An open-source software, it is widely used by various web browsers and text editors. This repository contains an implementation of the Kurdish morphological rules and annotated lexicon for the task of spell-checking and morphological analysis. To use these functionalities, see  [Kurdish Language Processing Toolkit (KLPT)](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/klpt). Moreover, this spell-checker is currently being added as an extension to LibreOffice and OpenOffice and therefore, can be used within many text editors and browsers as well.

Please note that the current version only contains Sorani Kurdish data. Kurmanji data will be also provided in a near future. **It should also be noted that the current project is the outcome of months of volunteer research and implementation. Please respect the terms of the license below.**


### Morphological rules

Sorani Kurdish morphology is notoriously complex. This is not only due to the number of affixes and clitics, but the way they appear and interact within a word-form. The following is an example on such a complexity for a single-word verb where the base *girt* of the verb *girtin* 'to take, to get' appears with clitics, suffixes and a verbal particle. The placement of the endoclitic *=√Æ≈ü* (in green boxes) and agent marker *=im* (in blue boxes) varies with respect to the base and each other in the verb form.

In order to extract morphological rules, the morphology of Sorani Kurdish is studied in a formal way in the paper entitled [ computational formalization of the Sorani Kurdish morphology](). This formalization allows various morpho-syntactic features of Sorani to be represented as rules which are presented in the [ckb-Arab.aff](ckb/ckb-Arab.aff) file. In version 0.1.0, inflectional and derivational rules regarding verbs, adjectives, adverbs and nouns are implemented. Next versions will include compound forms and further enrichments of the current categories.


### Lexicon annotation

As a rule-based method, Hunspell needs an annotated lexicon to which the morphological rules are applied. To this end, we use the lexicographic material provided by the [FreeDict project](https://freedict.org/) and [W√Æk√Æferheng, the Kurdish Wiktionary](https://ku.wiktionary.org/). In addition, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org) is consulted to extract proper names. The transliteration of the Latin-based script of Kurdish into the Arabic-based one is carried out using [Wergor](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/wergor). Each lemma in the lexicon is manually tagged with part-of-speech, its formation type (derivational/inflectional) and further morphological properties. In addition, composing parts of compound forms are specified using a hyphen. This way, the annotated lexicon is also used within the [Kurdish Tokenization project](https://github.com/sinaahmadi/KurdishTokenization).

According to the morphological rules, lemmata in our lexicons are tagged using the following flags. If the flags don't make much sense to you, the part of speech tags, i.e. `po` flag, will hopefully do as they are provided according to the [Universal Dependency tags](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html). The annotated lexicon is available at [ckb-Arab.dic](ckb/ckb-Arab.dic).

- `N`: Noun
- `V`: present stem of verbs
- `I`: past stem of intransitive verbs
- `T`: past stem of transitive verbs
- `A`: adjectives
- `R`: adverbs
- `E`: numerals
- `C`: conjunction
- `D`: interjection
- `B`: pronouns
- `E`: numerals
- `F`: adpositions
- `G`: particle
- `X`: infinitive
- `Z`: proper names
- `W`: irregular cases like *were* 'come.imp.2s'

The following is an example on how a few lemmata are tagged in our lexicon:

	ŸÅ€ïŸàÿ™€éŸÜÿ±ÿß/I po:verb is:past_stem_intransitive_passive
	ŸÅ€ïŸàÿ™€éŸÜÿ±ÿßŸÜ/XN po:verb is:infinitive_intransitive_passive
	ŸÅ€ïŸàÿ™€éŸÜÿ±€é/V po:verb is:present_stem_intransitive_passive
	ŸÅ€ïŸàÿØ€ï/ZN po:propn
	ŸÅ€ï⁄ï/N po:noun
	ŸÅ€ï⁄ïÿßÿ¥€ï/N po:noun
